            <h2> Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>

                <li> <em>  <strong> Tiger nuts (chufa nuts) or rice </strong> </em></li>
                <li> <em> <strong>Water </strong> </em></li>
                <li> <em> <strong> Sugar or sweetener (such as agave syrup or honey) </strong> </em></li>
                <li> <em> <strong>Cinnamon sticks (optional, for flavoring) </strong> </em></li>
                <li> <em> <strong> Vanilla extract (optional, for added flavor)</strong> </em></li>


            </ul>

            <h2> Preperation Instructions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>  Soak the Tiger Nuts or Rice: </strong>  If you're using tiger nuts, soak them in water overnight or for at least 8 hours to soften them. If you're using rice, rinse it thoroughly and soak it in water for a few hours or overnight.</li>
                <li> <strong> Drain and Rinse:</strong> After soaking, drain the tiger nuts or rice and rinse them well.</li>
                <li><strong> Blend:</strong>  In a blender, combine the soaked tiger nuts or rice with fresh water. The ratio typically used is about 1 cup of tiger nuts or rice to 3-4 cups of water, but you can adjust this to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Sweetener and Flavorings </strong> Add sugar or sweetener to the blender according to your taste preferences. You can also add cinnamon sticks and a splash of vanilla extract for additional flavor.</li>
                <li><strong> Blend Until Smooth: </strong> Blend the mixture on high speed until it becomes smooth and well combined. This may take a few minutes, depending on the power of your blender.</li>
                <li><strong> Strain: </strong> Place a nut milk bag, cheesecloth, or fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl or pitcher. Pour the blended mixture through the strainer to remove any solids, squeezing or pressing gently to extract as much liquid as possible. </li>
                <li> <strong> Chill and Serve:</strong> Once strained, refrigerate the horchata until cold. Before serving, stir the horchata well as it may separate during chilling. Serve over ice and enjoy!</li>
