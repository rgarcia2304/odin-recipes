        <h1> Birria </h1>

        <h2> Decription: </h2>
        <p> Birria is a traditional Mexican dish with a rich history and cultural significance, particularly hailing from the state of Jalisco. It is renowned for its flavorful stew, often made with goat meat or beef, although variations may include other meats such as lamb or pork. The origins of birria trace back to the indigenous communities of Mexico, where slow-cooking techniques and the use of local spices and herbs were prevalent.

            Originally, birria was cooked as a celebratory dish, often served during weddings, festivals, and other special occasions. It required long hours of cooking over an open flame or in underground pits, allowing the meat to tenderize and absorb the complex flavors of the spices and chilies used in the stew.
            
            One of the distinctive characteristics of birria is its rich, reddish-brown broth, which is achieved through the use of dried chilies, such as guajillo, ancho, and pasilla. These chilies not only contribute to the vibrant color but also impart a depth of flavor and mild heat to the dish. Other essential ingredients in birria include onions, garlic, bay leaves, cumin, cloves, and Mexican oregano, all of which play a role in creating its distinctive taste profile.
            
            In addition to its historical roots, birria has evolved over time and has become a beloved dish across Mexico and beyond. It has gained popularity in various forms, including tacos dorados de birria (crispy birria tacos), birria ramen, and even birria pizza, reflecting its adaptability and versatility in contemporary culinary trends.
            
            Birria's rise to international fame can be attributed to its bold flavors, comforting qualities, and the growing appreciation for authentic Mexican cuisine worldwide. It continues to be cherished as a symbol of tradition, community, and the artistry of Mexican gastronomy, embodying centuries of culinary heritage passed down through generations.

        <h2> Preperation Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>  Prepare the dried chilies by removing their stems and seeds. You can do this by tearing them open and shaking out the seeds. Toast the chilies on a dry skillet over medium heat for a few seconds on each side until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them.</li>
            <li> Once toasted, place the chilies in a bowl and cover them with hot water. Let them soak for about 20-30 minutes until they soften.</li>
            <li>While the chilies are soaking, heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add a splash of oil and brown the meat on all sides. This step adds flavor to the stew..</li>
            <li>Once the meat is browned, remove it from the pot and set it aside. In the same pot, add chopped onions and minced garlic. Saut√© until softened and fragrant.</li>
            <li>While the onions and garlic are cooking, drain the soaked chilies, reserving the soaking liquid. Place the chilies in a blender along with the vinegar, Mexican oregano, ground cumin, whole cloves, and a pinch of salt. Add some of the soaking liquid and blend until smooth, adding more liquid as needed to achieve a smooth paste.</li>
            <li>Add the chili paste to the pot with the onions and garlic. Cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly to prevent sticking. </li>
            <li> Return the browned meat to the pot. Add bay leaves and enough water or beef broth to cover the meat. Season with salt to taste.</li>
            <li> Bring the stew to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the birria simmer gently for 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and falls apart easily.</li>
            <li>Once the meat is tender, remove it from the pot and shred it using two forks.</li>
            <li> Skim any excess fat from the surface of the stew. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the birria hot, garnished with chopped cilantro, diced onions, lime wedges, and radishes. Birria is often served with warm tortillas or crusty bread for dipping.</li>
